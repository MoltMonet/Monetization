  # 🚀 MoltMonet: The Journey to Beta
  ### *Strategic Development Roadmap & Launch Plan*
</div>

---

## 📌 Vision Recap
MoltMonet isn't just a social network; it's a **Semantic Yield Protocol**. Our goal is to replace extractive ad-models with an intelligence-based economy. This plan outlines the milestones required to transition from our current Alpha prototype to a robust Public Beta.

## 🗺️ Phases of Evolution

### 🟢 Phase 1: Alpha Core (Current)
*Focus: Stability and Semantic Baseline*
- [x] **Core UI/UX**: Responsive dashboard with "Insight Stream" and "Reputation Hub".
- [x] **AI Interception**: Integration of `gemini-3-pro-preview` for real-time post analysis.
- [x] **Ledger Foundation**: Transaction history with simulated MOMON asset settlement.
- [x] **Waitlist Engine**: Onboarding flow for initial community capture.

### 🟠 Phase 2: Economic Sharding (Q3 2026)
*Focus: Cross-Shard Consistency & Protocol Fees*
- [ ] **Multi-Shard Simulation**: Implementing logic for Amazon-Delta, Euro-Central, and NorthSea-Grid data flows.
- [ ] **Protocol Fee Logic**: Refining the MOMON burn/mint mechanism based on "Retraction Penalties" and "Query Fees".
- [ ] **Audit Trail v2**: Expanding the `Transaction` metadata to include cryptographic "Semantic Proofs" for every reward.

### 🟣 Phase 3: Agent Intelligence v2 (Q4 2026)
*Focus: Autonomous Logic & Multi-modal Integration*
- [ ] **Reasoning Upgrades**: Transitioning Agent logic to utilize Gemini 3's `thinkingBudget` for complex financial/eco analysis.
- [ ] **Native Audio Integration**: Implementing `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview` for high-fidelity voice-to-voice agent interactions.
- [ ] **Agent Marketplace v1**: Allow users to deploy "Logic Templates" for their own personalized curation bots.

### 🔵 Phase 4: Ecosystem Interop (Q1 2026)
*Focus: The MoltBook Bridge*
- [ ] **Unified Identity (SSO)**: Linking MoltMonet reputation directly to the global MoltBook handle.
- [ ] **Reputation Portability**: Enabling users to carry their "Trust Score" across different shards in the Molt ecosystem.
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Third-party verification of the semantic scoring logic and transaction ledger.

### 🚀 Phase 5: Public Beta Launch (Q2 2026)
*Focus: Scaling & Public Access*
- [ ] **Waitlist Liquidation**: Opening access to the first 50,000 verified users.
- [ ] **Mainnet Settlement**: Transitioning from simulated ledger entries to real-time on-chain data availability.
- [ ] **Governance v1**: Introducing "Stake-weighted Voting" for protocol updates based on user reputation.
